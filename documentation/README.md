## 1. Running Instructions 
You can run the deliverable application for Increment 1 using the `java -jar` command on a terminal window, or by clicking the `.jar` file itself.

To compile the Increment 1 deliverable application from source code you'll need to have **Maven** installed on your machine. 
Our application requires **Apache Maven 3.8.4** or later and at least **Java version 17.**

This will compile the application. You can then run it using `mvn javafx:run`.
